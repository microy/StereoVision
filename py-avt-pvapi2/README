py-pvt-api2
======================================

py-pvt-api2 provides a set of convenient python bindings for the GigE SDK 
by Allied Vision Technologies.

This version supports the Windows, Linux and Mac OS X versions
of this library on both 32 and 64 bit platforms.

Requirements:
	You need the PvAPI library which can be downloaded from:
	(http://www.alliedvisiontec.com/us/products/software/windows/avt-pvapi-sdk.html)
	The included folder PvAPI contains version 1.24 of these libraries and demonstrates
	the folder structure to ensure the wrapper can find the correct library.

Usage Notes:
	Check the example in example.py. Note that the wrapper requires Numpy to work and
	the examples use OpenCV 2.3 for the GUI and colour conversion.
	
Todo:
	Support multichannel image formats. The wrapper currently only supports single layer
	formats such as Mono8/16 and Bayer8/16. Other formats such as Rgb24 and Yuv411 are not supported.
